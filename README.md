`hasql` provides simple and reliable way to access high-availability database setups with multiple hosts.

## Status
`hasql` is production-ready and is actively used inside Yandex' production environment.

Although it is released as v0.9.0, it is done so only to enable possible API changes based on community feedback.

## Prerequisites

- **[Go](https://golang.org)**: any one of the **two latest major** [releases](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html).

## Installation

With [Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support, simply add the following import

```go
import "golang.yandex/hasql"
```

to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]` will automatically fetch the
necessary dependencies.

Otherwise, to install the `hasql` package, run the following command:

```console
$ go get -u golang.yandex/hasql
```

## How does it work
`hasql` operates using standard `database/sql` connection pool objects. User creates `*sql.DB` objects for each node of database cluster and passes them to constructor. Library keeps up to date information on state of each node by 'pinging' them periodically. User is provided with a set of interfaces to retrieve `*sql.DB` object suitable for required operation.

```go
dbFoo, _ := sql.Open("pgx", "host=foo")
dbBar, _ := sql.Open("pgx", "host=bar")
cl, err := hasql.NewCluster(
    []hasql.Node{hasql.NewNode("foo", dbFoo), hasql.NewNode("bar", dbBar) },
    checkers.PostgreSQL,
)
if err != nil { ... }

node := cl.Primary()
if node == nil { ... }

// Do anything you like
fmt.Println("Node address", node.Addr)

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()
if err = node.DB().PingContext(ctx); err != nil { ... }
```

`hasql` does not configure provided connection pools in any way. It is user's job to set them up properly. Library does handle their lifetime though - pools are closed when `Cluster` object is closed.

### Supported criteria
_Alive primary_|_Alive standby_|_Any alive_ node, or _none_ otherwise
```go
node := c.Primary()
if node == nil { ... }
```

_Alive primary_|_Alive standby_, or _any alive_ node, or _none_ otherwise
```go
node := c.PreferPrimary()
if node == nil { ... }
```

### Ways of accessing nodes
Any of _currently alive_ nodes _satisfying criteria_, or _none_ otherwise
```go
node := c.Primary()
if node == nil { ... }
```

Any of _currently alive_ nodes _satisfying criteria_, or _wait_ for one to become _alive_
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()
node, err := c.WaitForPrimary(ctx)
if err == nil { ... }
```

## Supported databases
Since library works over standard `database/sql` it supports any database that has a `database/sql` driver. All it requires is a database-specific checker function that can tell if node is primary or standby.

Check out `golang.yandex/hasql/checkers` package for more information.

### Caveats
Node's state is transient at any given time. If `Primary()` returns a node it does not mean that node is still primary when you execute statement on it. All it means is that it was primary when it was last checked. Nodes can change their state at a whim or even go offline and `hasql` can't control it in any manner.

This is one of the reasons why nodes do not expose their perceived state to user.

## Extensions
### Instrumentation
You can add instrumentation via `Tracer` object similar to [httptrace](https://godoc.org/net/http/httptrace) in standard library.

### sqlx
`hasql` can operate over `database/sql` pools wrapped with [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx). It works the same as with standard library but requires user to import `golang.yandex/hasql/sqlx` instead.

Refer to `golang.yandex/hasql/sqlx` package for more information.
